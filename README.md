Experiment:
    - Feed in landmarks + R & T matrices instead of driving image: this way you could swap out mouth landmarks for what you want
    
<!-- Pick up point -->
2) Warping Generators
    - Rotate and translate the warp grids
    - Rotate and translate directly the volumetric features as opposed to the warp grids?
3) Test Appearance encoder

5) Inference
6) Highres model
7) Student distillation model
